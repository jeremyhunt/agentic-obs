## Scene Management

### list_scenes

**Purpose:** Retrieve all available scenes in OBS and identify which scene is currently active.

**Parameters:** None

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "scenes": ["Scene 1", "Scene 2", "Gaming", "Chatting"],
  "current_scene": "Gaming"
}
```

**Return Fields:**
- `scenes` (array of strings): List of all scene names in OBS
- `current_scene` (string): Name of the currently active scene

**Use Cases:**
- Display available scenes to users before switching
- Verify a scene exists before attempting to activate it
- Build scene selection menus in AI-driven interfaces
- Audit scene configuration across multiple OBS instances
- Create scene-based workflows and automation

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "What scenes do I have in OBS?"
- "Show me all available scenes and which one is active"
- "List my OBS scenes"
- "Which scene am I currently on?"
- "What's my current scene setup?"

**Error Scenarios:**
- OBS not connected: "failed to list scenes: OBS client not connected"
- WebSocket error: Connection timeout or authentication failure
- No scenes exist: Returns empty array (unlikely, OBS always has at least one scene)

**Prerequisites:**
- Active OBS WebSocket connection

**Related Tools:**
- `set_current_scene` - Switch to a different scene
- `create_scene` - Add new scenes
- `remove_scene` - Delete existing scenes
- `get_obs_status` - Includes current scene in overall status

**Best Practices:**
- Call this before `set_current_scene` to validate scene names
- Cache results for short periods to reduce OBS queries
- Use current_scene to avoid redundant scene switches
- Consider scenes as MCP resources for real-time updates via notifications

---

### set_current_scene

**Purpose:** Switch the active program scene in OBS to a different scene.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| scene_name | string | Yes | Exact name of the scene to activate |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully switched to scene: Gaming"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Automate scene transitions during streams (e.g., "Switch to BRB scene")
- Respond to events (chat commands, timers, external triggers)
- Create multi-scene workflows for presentations or tutorials
- Quick scene changes via voice commands
- Coordinate scene changes with other OBS operations

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "Switch to my Gaming scene"
- "Change to the BRB scene"
- "Go to the Chatting layout"
- "Activate my intro scene"
- "Switch OBS to the main camera view"

**Error Scenarios:**
- Scene doesn't exist: "failed to set current scene to 'InvalidName': Scene may not exist"
- Invalid scene name: Same as above
- OBS not connected: "OBS client not connected"
- Empty scene name: OBS WebSocket will reject the request

**Prerequisites:**
- Scene must exist in OBS (use `list_scenes` to verify)
- Active OBS connection

**Related Tools:**
- `list_scenes` - Verify scene exists before switching
- `create_scene` - Create scene if it doesn't exist
- `get_obs_status` - Verify scene change was successful

**Best Practices:**
- Always verify scene exists using `list_scenes` first
- Scene names are case-sensitive - match exactly
- Consider transition duration when coordinating with other actions
- Use with recording/streaming controls for automated workflows
- Combine with source visibility toggles for complex scene states

### create_scene

**Purpose:** Create a new empty scene in OBS.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| scene_name | string | Yes | Name for the new scene (must be unique) |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "message": "Successfully created scene: NewScene"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Dynamically create scenes for different content types
- Build custom scene layouts programmatically
- Automated setup for recurring events or shows
- Template-based scene generation
- User-requested custom scenes via chat commands

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "Create a new scene called 'Tutorial Mode'"
- "Make a scene named 'Guest Interview'"
- "Add a new OBS scene for the Q&A session"
- "Set up a scene called 'Screen Share'"
- "Create a blank scene called 'Backup'"

**Error Scenarios:**
- Scene already exists: "failed to create scene 'Gaming': Scene may already exist"
- Empty scene name: OBS WebSocket validation error
- Special characters: May be rejected depending on OBS version
- Maximum scenes reached: OBS resource limitation (rare)

**Prerequisites:**
- Active OBS connection
- Unique scene name not currently in use

**Related Tools:**
- `list_scenes` - Verify scene was created
- `remove_scene` - Delete scenes no longer needed
- `set_current_scene` - Switch to newly created scene
- MCP resources - New scenes trigger `resources/list_changed` notification

**Best Practices:**
- Check if scene exists first using `list_scenes` to avoid errors
- Use descriptive, unique names
- Newly created scenes are empty - add sources separately
- Consider scene naming conventions for organization
- Clean up unused scenes periodically with `remove_scene`

---

### remove_scene

**Purpose:** Delete an existing scene from OBS.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| scene_name | string | Yes | Exact name of the scene to remove |

- "Delete the scene called 'Backup'"
- "Remove all scenes with 'temp' in the name" (requires iteration)

**Error Scenarios:**
- Scene doesn't exist: "failed to remove scene 'InvalidName': Scene may not exist"
- Last remaining scene: "Scene may not exist or may be the only scene" (OBS requires at least one scene)
- Currently active scene: Some OBS versions prevent deletion of active scene
- Scene in use: May fail if scene is referenced elsewhere

**Prerequisites:**
- Scene must exist in OBS
- OBS must have at least one other scene (cannot delete the only scene)
- Scene should not be currently active (switch first if needed)

**Related Tools:**
- `list_scenes` - Verify scene exists before attempting removal
- `set_current_scene` - Switch away from scene before deleting
- `create_scene` - Create scenes to replace deleted ones
- MCP resources - Deletion triggers `resources/list_changed` notification

**Best Practices:**
- Always check if scene exists first
- Switch to a different scene before deleting the current one
- Confirm with user before deleting scenes (destructive operation)
- Cannot undo scene deletion - all sources in scene are lost
- Use scene naming conventions to identify temporary scenes

- Identify source types for appropriate handling

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "What sources do I have in OBS?"
- "List all my audio and video inputs"
- "Show me available sources"
- "What cameras and microphones are configured?"
- "Display all OBS inputs"

**Error Scenarios:**
- OBS not connected: "failed to list sources from OBS: OBS client not connected"
- WebSocket error: Connection or authentication issue
- No sources configured: Returns empty array

**Prerequisites:**
- Active OBS connection
- Sources configured in OBS (not required, will return empty array)

**Related Tools:**
- `get_source_settings` - Get detailed configuration for a source
- `toggle_source_visibility` - Show/hide source in scene
- `get_input_mute` - Check audio source mute state
- `set_input_volume` - Adjust audio source volume

**Best Practices:**
- Use to validate source names before operations
- Cache source list to reduce OBS queries
- Filter by inputKind to find specific source types
- Sources are global - can be added to multiple scenes
- Note: This lists input sources, not scene items
- Use scene resource queries for per-scene source instances

### toggle_source_visibility

**Purpose:** Toggle the visibility/enabled state of a source within a specific scene.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| scene_name | string | Yes | Name of the scene containing the source |
| source_id | integer | Yes | Scene item ID of the source (not source name) |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "scene_name": "Gaming",
  "source_id": 5,
  "visible": true
}
```

**Return Fields:**
- `scene_name` (string): Name of the scene
- `source_id` (integer): Scene item ID that was toggled
- `visible` (boolean): New visibility state after toggle

**Use Cases:**
- Show/hide overlays during streams
- Toggle webcam visibility on command
- Reveal/hide alerts or notifications
- Create interactive scene elements
- Automated source visibility workflows

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "Toggle my webcam in the Gaming scene"
- "Hide the chat overlay"
- "Show source ID 5 in the current scene"
- "Toggle visibility of the alert box"
- "Switch the webcam on/off"

**Error Scenarios:**
- Scene doesn't exist: "failed to get visibility state for source X in scene 'InvalidScene'"
- Invalid source ID: "failed to get visibility state for source 999"
- Source not in scene: Source ID doesn't exist in specified scene
- OBS not connected: WebSocket connection issue

**Prerequisites:**
- Scene must exist in OBS
- Source ID must be valid for that scene
- Active OBS connection

**Related Tools:**
- `list_scenes` - Get available scenes
- Scene resources (MCP) - Get source IDs within scenes
- `list_sources` - List available sources (but not scene item IDs)
- `get_source_settings` - Get source configuration

**Best Practices:**
- Use MCP scene resources to get valid source IDs
- Source ID is per-scene, not global source name
- Same source can have different IDs in different scenes
- Returns new state for confirmation
- Consider using scene resources/read to get source details
- Toggle is atomic - gets current state and flips it

### get_source_settings

**Purpose:** Retrieve the configuration settings for a specific input source.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| source_name | string | Yes | Exact name of the source |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "device_id": "default",
  "use_device_timing": false,
  "sample_rate": 48000
}
```
(Schema varies by source type - example shows audio input)

**Return Fields:**
- Varies by source type
- Common fields: device settings, paths, URLs, credentials
- Returns source-specific configuration as key-value pairs

**Use Cases:**
- Inspect source configuration programmatically
- Verify device settings
- Debug source issues
- Audit source configuration across setups
- Document source settings for backup/restore

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "What are the settings for my Webcam source?"
- "Show me the configuration for Desktop Audio"
- "Get the settings for the 'Game Capture' source"
- "What device is my microphone using?"
- "Display source settings for 'Browser Source'"

### set_source_settings

**Purpose:** Write a source's own settings -- what the source *is* (a browser source's URL, a text source's text, an image source's file), as distinct from where it sits in a scene.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| source_name | string | Yes | Exact name of the source |
| settings | object | Yes | Settings to apply |
| overlay | boolean | No | Merge into existing settings (default `true`). `false` replaces them entirely |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "source_name": "OVERLAY_NowPlaying",
  "overlay": true,
  "message": "Settings applied to 'OVERLAY_NowPlaying'"
}
```

**Overlay semantics:**
- `true` (default) merges: keys you supply are updated, everything else is left alone.
- `false` resets the source to its kind's defaults and *then* applies your settings, so any key you omit reverts to its default.

Use `false` only when the settings you pass are meant to be the complete state -- restoring a saved configuration, for instance. For a single-field edit, leave it alone.

**Use Cases:**
- Retarget a browser source at a new URL
- Change the text of a text source
- Swap the file behind an image or media source
- Restore a source's full configuration from a saved copy

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "Point the NowPlaying overlay at localhost:8080"
- "Change the Starting Soon text to 'Back in 5'"
- "Swap the background image to bg-night.png"

---

### press_source_properties_button

**Purpose:** Press a button on a source's properties dialog. Some source behaviour is reachable only this way, because the button triggers an action rather than storing a setting.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| source_name | string | Yes | Exact name of the source |
| property_name | string | Yes | Name of the button property |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "source_name": "OVERLAY_NowPlaying",
  "property_name": "refreshnocache",
  "message": "Pressed 'refreshnocache' on 'OVERLAY_NowPlaying'"
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- Reload a browser source bypassing its cache (`refreshnocache`)
- Trigger a source-specific action exposed only as a button

**Why prefer this to a cache-busting URL:** pressing the button changes no stored settings. Appending a query parameter rewrites the URL, which other writers of that URL will notice -- and in this workspace the Starting Soon overlay has two writers.

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "Reload the NowPlaying overlay"
- "Refresh the browser source without caching"

---

### get_input_default_settings

**Purpose:** Get the default settings for an input kind. Defaults belong to the kind rather than to any one source, so this works without creating anything.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| input_kind | string | Yes | Input kind, e.g. `browser_source` (see `list_input_kinds`) |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "url": "https://obsproject.com/browser-source",
  "width": 800,
  "height": 600,
  "css": ""
}
```
(Schema varies by input kind)

**Use Cases:**
- Discover which settings keys a kind accepts, instead of guessing names
- Tell a deliberate setting apart from one that merely equals its default
- Build a correct `settings` object before calling `create_source` or `set_source_settings`

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "What settings does a browser source take?"
- "Show me the defaults for a colour source"

---

### list_input_property_items

**Purpose:** List the selectable items of a source property -- the contents of a dropdown in the properties dialog.

**Parameters:**
| Name | Type | Required | Description |
|------|------|----------|-------------|
| source_name | string | Yes | Exact name of the source |
| property_name | string | Yes | Property to enumerate |

**Return Value Schema:**
```json
{
  "source_name": "Window Capture",
  "property_name": "window",
  "items": [
    { "name": "[obs64.exe]: OBS 32.2.2", "value": "OBS...:obs64.exe" }
  ],
  "count": 1
}
```

**Return Fields:**
- `items[].name` -- the label OBS shows
- `items[].value` -- what `set_source_settings` expects; write this, not the label
- `count` -- number of items

**Use Cases:**
- Find the windows available to a `window_capture`
- Find the monitors available to a `monitor_capture`
- Enumerate audio devices for an input

**Example Natural Language Prompts:**
- "Which windows can I capture?"
- "List the audio devices for my microphone"

**Error Scenarios:**
- Source doesn't exist: "failed to get settings for source 'InvalidName': Source may not exist"
- Source name incorrect: Same as above (case-sensitive)
- OBS not connected: WebSocket connection issue

**Prerequisites:**
- Source must exist in OBS
- Exact source name required
- Active OBS connection

**Related Tools:**
- `list_sources` - Get available source names
- `toggle_source_visibility` - Control source visibility
- `get_input_mute` - Audio source mute state
- `set_input_volume` - Audio source volume

**Best Practices:**
- Use `list_sources` to get exact source names first
- Source names are case-sensitive
- Settings structure varies by source type
- Some settings may contain sensitive data (URLs, credentials)
- Read-only operation, doesn't modify settings
- Future enhancement: set_source_settings for modification

## Common Patterns

### Pre-Flight Checks
Before starting a stream or recording:
```
1. get_obs_status - Verify OBS connection and performance
2. list_scenes - Confirm scenes exist
3. list_sources - Verify sources are configured
4. get_recording_status / get_streaming_status - Ensure not already active
5. set_current_scene - Switch to starting scene
6. start_streaming / start_recording - Begin output
```

### Scene Workflow
Creating and managing scenes:
```
1. list_scenes - Check if scene exists
2. create_scene - Create if needed
3. [Add sources to scene - future capability]
4. set_current_scene - Switch to new scene
5. toggle_source_visibility - Show/hide elements
```

### Audio Management
Complete audio control:
```
1. list_sources - Find audio inputs
2. get_input_mute - Check current state
3. toggle_input_mute - Mute/unmute
4. set_input_volume - Adjust levels
5. get_source_settings - Verify configuration
```

### Recording Session
Full recording workflow:
```
1. get_recording_status - Verify not already recording
2. set_current_scene - Switch to recording scene
3. start_recording - Begin capture
4. [During recording: pause_recording / resume_recording as needed]
5. get_recording_status - Monitor duration and size
6. stop_recording - End and save file
```

### Streaming Session
Complete streaming workflow:
```
1. get_streaming_status - Verify not already streaming
2. get_obs_status - Check performance
3. set_current_scene - Switch to starting soon scene
4. start_streaming - Go live
5. set_current_scene - Switch to main scene
6. [During stream: monitor with get_streaming_status]
7. set_current_scene - Switch to ending scene
8. stop_streaming - End stream
```

## Error Handling

### Common Error Patterns

**OBS Not Connected:**
```
Error: "OBS client not connected"
Solution: Verify OBS is running and WebSocket server is enabled
Check: OBS → Tools → WebSocket Server Settings
```

**Resource Not Found:**
```
Error: "Scene/Source/Input may not exist"
Solution: Use list_* tools to verify resource names
Check: Names are case-sensitive and must match exactly
```

**Already Active:**
```
Error: "output already active" (recording/streaming)
Solution: Check status before starting
Use: get_recording_status or get_streaming_status first
```

**Invalid State:**
```
Error: "Recording may not be paused" (when trying to resume)
Solution: Verify current state matches required precondition
Use: Status tools to confirm state before operations
```

**Authentication Failed:**
```
Error: WebSocket authentication failure
Solution: Verify password in agentic-obs configuration
Check: OBS WebSocket settings and stored credentials
```

### Error Recovery Strategies

1. **Connection Issues:** Check OBS is running, WebSocket enabled, correct port/password
2. **Resource Issues:** Use list tools to verify names before operations
3. **State Issues:** Check status before state-changing operations
4. **Permission Issues:** Verify disk space, write permissions for recording
5. **Configuration Issues:** Validate OBS settings for streaming/recording

### Validation Best Practices

- Always verify resources exist before operating on them
- Check status before start/stop operations to avoid errors
- Use exact, case-sensitive names for scenes/sources/inputs
- Handle errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
- Log errors for debugging and monitoring

## MCP Resources

MCP resources provide direct access to OBS data structures, enabling clients to read and monitor OBS state efficiently. Unlike tools (which perform actions), resources expose data that can be read, listed, and monitored for changes.

### What are MCP Resources?

Resources are addressable data objects exposed via URI patterns. Clients can:
- **List** all available resources of a given type
- **Read** individual resource content (JSON or binary)
- **Subscribe** to notifications when resources change (future enhancement)

### Available Resources

The agentic-obs server exposes three types of resources:

#### 1. Scene Resources

**URI Pattern:** `obs://scene/{sceneName}`
**Content Type:** `obs-scene` (JSON)
**Description:** Scene configuration including sources, settings, and current state

**Example Resource URI:** `obs://scene/Gaming`

**Content Structure:**
```json
{
  "name": "Gaming",
  "sources": [
    {"id": 1, "name": "Webcam", "visible": true},
    {"id": 2, "name": "Chat Overlay", "visible": false}
  ],
  "is_current": true
}
```

**Notifications:**
- `notifications/resources/list_changed` - When scenes are created or deleted
- `notifications/resources/updated` - When a specific scene is modified or becomes active

#### 2. Screenshot Resources

**URI Pattern:** `obs://screenshot/{sourceName}`
**Content Type:** `image/png` or `image/jpeg` (binary)
**Description:** Binary image data from screenshot capture sources

**Example Resource URI:** `obs://screenshot/stream-monitor`

**Content:** Binary image data (PNG or JPEG format)

**Use Cases:**
- Direct image access for AI visual analysis
- Embed screenshots in MCP resource workflows
- Monitor stream output visually

**Note:** Screenshot resources require creating a screenshot source first using the `create_screenshot_source` tool.

#### 3. Preset Resources

**URI Pattern:** `obs://preset/{presetName}`
**Content Type:** `obs-preset` (JSON)
**Description:** Scene preset configuration with source visibility states

**Example Resource URI:** `obs://preset/gaming-webcam-on`

**Content Structure:**
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "gaming-webcam-on",
  "scene_name": "Gaming",
  "description": "Full overlay with webcam",
  "sources": [
    {"name": "Webcam", "visible": true},
    {"name": "Chat Overlay", "visible": true},
    {"name": "Alert Box", "visible": true}
  ],
  "created_at": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

### Using Resources

**List All Resources:**
```
Client: resources/list
Server: Returns list of all resources across all types (scenes, screenshots, presets)
```

**Read Specific Resource:**
```
Client: resources/read with URI "obs://scene/Gaming"
Server: Returns JSON scene configuration
```

**Monitor Changes:**
Resources send notifications when they change, allowing clients to stay synchronized with OBS state in real-time.

### Resource vs Tool Usage

- **Use Resources when:** You need to read/monitor OBS state, require notifications on changes, or want structured data access
- **Use Tools when:** You need to perform actions or modify OBS state

**Example:** Use `resources/read` on `obs://scene/Gaming` to get scene configuration, but use the `set_current_scene` tool to switch to that scene.
