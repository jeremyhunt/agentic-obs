# Scene Designer

Expert guidance for creating and arranging visual elements in OBS Studio scenes, from simple text overlays to complex multi-source layouts.

## When to Use This Skill

Activate the **scene-designer** skill when users request help with:

- **Creating new sources**
  - "Add a text overlay"
  - "Put my webcam on screen"
  - "Add a browser source for alerts"
  - "Create a background color"
  - "Add a video/media source"

- **Positioning and layout**
  - "Move my webcam to the corner"
  - "Resize the game capture"
  - "Center this source"
  - "Arrange my layout"

- **Source management**
  - "Remove this source"
  - "Duplicate my overlay"
  - "Lock this source in place"
  - "Bring webcam to front"

- **Scene composition**
  - "Design a starting screen"
  - "Create a professional layout"
  - "Set up picture-in-picture"
  - "Build an intermission scene"

## The loop

Design is not a calculation you get right first time. It is a loop, and the
verify step is the one that was missing:

1. **Read the canvas** -- `get_obs_status`, use `video.base_width` /
   `video.base_height`. Never assume a resolution.
2. **Make it exist** -- `ensure_input` rather than `create_*` when the source
   may already be there. It is safe to re-run and tells you whether it created,
   placed, updated or changed nothing.
3. **Place it** -- `set_source_transform` with a `fit` block. Say the intent;
   OBS does the scaling.
4. **Look at it** -- `take_screenshot`. Actually look. This is not optional and
   it is not a formality.
5. **Adjust and repeat** from 3.

### Always verify visually

`take_screenshot` returns the image in the same turn, so you can see what you
just did rather than reason about whether it should have worked.

Do it after every placement, and look for the things coordinates cannot tell
you: a source off-canvas, a transparent background rendering black, text clipped
by its bounding box, a layer in front of something it should be behind.

Pass `width` to keep it cheap -- a full-resolution capture of a 2560x1440 canvas
is about 1.4 MB, the same frame at `width: 1280` is around 500 KB, and as JPEG
around 56 KB. Placement is just as legible at the smaller sizes.

If you have not looked at a screenshot, you do not know the layout is right; you
know the call returned success, which is a different claim.

## Core Responsibilities

As the **scene-designer**, your role is to:

1. **Create visual sources** (text, images, colors, browsers, media)
2. **Position and transform sources** (move, scale, rotate)
3. **Manage source ordering** (layering, z-index)
4. **Configure cropping and bounds** for clean compositions
5. **Lock sources** to prevent accidental movement
6. **Duplicate sources** for efficiency
7. **Remove sources** when no longer needed

## Available Tools

### Source Creation (6 tools)
- `ensure_input` - **Prefer this.** Create-or-update for any kind: makes a
  source exist in a scene with the settings you describe, whatever state things
  are in. Safe to re-run; reports `created`, `placed`, `updated` or `unchanged`.
  The `create_*` tools below fail when the name is taken unless you pass
  `if_exists`.
- `create_text_source` - Add text overlays with customizable font, size, color
- `create_image_source` - Add static images (PNG, JPG, etc.)
- `create_color_source` - Add solid color rectangles (backgrounds, overlays)
- `create_browser_source` - Add web content (alerts, widgets, animations)
- `create_media_source` - Add video/audio files with optional looping

### Seeing your work (1 tool)
- `take_screenshot` - Capture a source or scene and get the image back in the
  same turn. The verify step of every loop above.

### Configuration (2 tools)
- `set_source_settings` - Change what a source *is* (a browser source's URL, a
  text source's text, an image's file), as distinct from where it sits
- `get_input_default_settings` - Discover a kind's settings keys instead of
  guessing them

### Transform & Layout (4 tools)
- `set_source_transform` - Position (x, y), scale, and rotate sources
- `get_source_transform` - Read current position, scale, rotation
- `set_source_crop` - Crop source edges (top, bottom, left, right)
- `set_source_bounds` - Set bounding box type and alignment

### Source Management (4 tools)
- `set_source_locked` - Lock/unlock source position
- `set_source_order` - Change z-order (bring to front, send to back)
- `duplicate_source` - Copy a source within the scene
- `remove_source` - Delete a source from the scene

### Utility (1 tool)
- `list_input_kinds` - List available source types in OBS

### Source Filters (7 tools)
Filters modify the visual or audio output of a source without changing
the source itself. Common uses: color correction on a webcam, chroma
key for green-screen, noise suppression on a mic, sharpen/blur effects.

- `list_source_filters` - Enumerate filters on a source with kind + enabled state
- `get_source_filter` - Fetch one filter's settings + index
- `create_source_filter` - Add a filter (e.g. `color_filter_v2`, `chroma_key_filter_v2`)
- `remove_source_filter` - Delete a filter from a source
- `toggle_source_filter` - Enable/disable without removing
- `set_source_filter_settings` - Tune existing filter params
- `list_filter_kinds` - Discover every filter kind OBS supports on this machine

**Filter ordering matters** — filters apply top-to-bottom in the list.
Place `chroma_key` BEFORE `color_correction` so the key uses the raw
input; place `sharpen` LAST so it doesn't amplify keying artifacts.

## Canvas Understanding

OBS uses a coordinate system with:
- **Origin (0, 0)**: Top-left corner
- **X-axis**: Increases rightward
- **Y-axis**: Increases downward

### Read the canvas; never assume it

**Always call `get_obs_status` first and use `video.base_width` /
`video.base_height`.** This skill used to carry a table of coordinates for a
1920x1080 canvas. That table was wrong on the machine it was written for, whose
canvas is 2560x1440 -- every placement computed from it landed 640x360 pixels
off, which is enough to put a corner-anchored overlay off-screen rather than
merely off-centre.

`video.base_*` is the coordinate space scene items live in. `video.output_*` is
what OBS encodes after any downscale, and is **not** the space to place against:
a source at x=2000 is on-canvas at 2560 wide even when the output is 1920.

### Prefer `fit` to coordinates

`set_source_transform` takes a `fit` block that places against the canvas
without you computing anything:

```json
{ "scene_name": "Live", "source_name": "Webcam",
  "fit": { "mode": "fill", "anchor": "bottom-right",
           "region": { "x": 1920, "y": 1080, "width": 640, "height": 360 } } }
```

| mode | what OBS does |
|------|---------------|
| `fit` | whole source visible inside the region, letterboxed |
| `fill` | covers the region, overflowing edges cropped |
| `stretch` | fills the region, aspect ratio ignored |
| `width` / `height` | matches that dimension, the other follows |
| `shrink` | scales down to fit, never up |
| `none` | clears the bounding box (for assets already authored at canvas size) |

Omit `region` to mean the whole canvas. `anchor` decides where the source sits
when the mode leaves spare space: `center` (default), `top-left`, `top`,
`top-right`, `left`, `right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom`, `bottom-right`.

These map onto OBS's own bounding-box types, so OBS does the scaling. That is
why `fit` keeps working when an asset is swapped for one of a different size,
and hand-computed coordinates do not.

### Scale Values
- `1.0` = 100% (original size)
- `0.5` = 50% (half size)
- `2.0` = 200% (double size)

### Rotation
- Values in degrees (0-360)
- Positive = clockwise rotation
- Common: 0, 90, 180, 270

## Source Creation Workflows

### Adding a Text Overlay

```
User: "Add my stream title"

1. Gather information:
   - Ask: "What text should it display?"
   - Ask: "Where should it appear? (top, bottom, corner)"

2. Create the source:
   - Use create_text_source with:
     - scene_name: current scene
     - source_name: descriptive name like "Stream Title"
     - text: user's text
     - font_size: 48 for titles, 24 for subtitles
     - color: white (default) or user preference

3. Position the source:
   - Use set_source_transform to place at desired location
   - Example: top-center would be x: 960, y: 50

4. Confirm:
   - Report: "Added 'Stream Title' text at top center"
```

### Adding a Webcam Overlay

```
User: "Put my webcam in the corner"

1. Clarify:
   - Ask: "Which corner: bottom-left, bottom-right, top-left, or top-right?"
   - Ask: "How large should it be? (small, medium, large)"

2. User: "Bottom right, medium size"

3. Position the webcam:
   - Use get_source_transform to get current webcam properties
   - Calculate position for bottom-right:
     - For medium (320x180): x: 1580, y: 880
   - Use set_source_transform with:
     - x: 1580, y: 880
     - scale_x: 0.25, scale_y: 0.25 (for medium)

4. Lock it in place:
   - Use set_source_locked to prevent accidental movement

5. Confirm:
   - Report: "Webcam positioned bottom-right at medium size and locked"
```

### Creating a Color Background

```
User: "Add a dark background"

1. Create color source:
   - Use create_color_source with:
     - scene_name: current scene
     - source_name: "Dark Background"
     - color: 0xFF1A1A2E (dark blue-gray) or 0xFF000000 (pure black)
     - width: 1920, height: 1080

2. Send to back:
   - Use set_source_order to move behind other sources

3. Confirm:
   - Report: "Added dark background behind all other sources"
```

### Adding a Browser Widget

```
User: "Add my Streamlabs alerts"

1. Gather URL:
   - Ask: "What's the widget URL from Streamlabs?"

2. Create browser source:
   - Use create_browser_source with:
     - source_name: "Alert Box"
     - url: user's widget URL
     - width: 800, height: 600 (typical for alerts)

3. Position:
   - Use set_source_transform to center or place as needed
   - Alerts typically go in top area: x: 560, y: 50

4. Bring to front:
   - Use set_source_order to ensure visibility over other sources

5. Confirm:
   - Report: "Alert box added at top center"
```

### Adding a Chroma Key (Green Screen) to a Webcam

```
1. Pick the source:
   - Use list_sources to find the webcam source name

2. Survey existing filters:
   - list_source_filters for that source so you know the current order

3. Create the key filter:
   - create_source_filter with:
       kind: "chroma_key_filter_v2"
       settings: {
         key_color_type: "green",
         similarity: 400,    // 1–1000, start at 400
         smoothness: 80,     // 1–1000, soften edges
         spill: 100          // remove green fringe
       }
   - Place it at the top of the filter chain (index: 0) so later
     filters work on the keyed output.

4. Verify:
   - toggle_source_filter off then on to show user the before/after
   - If hair edges look rough: raise smoothness. If background bleeds
     through: raise similarity. If green tint remains: raise spill.
```

### Color-Correcting a Webcam

```
1. list_source_filters to check for an existing color filter
2. If none exists:
   create_source_filter:
     kind: "color_filter_v2"
     settings: {gamma: 0.0, contrast: 0.0, brightness: 0.0, saturation: 0.0, hue_shift: 0.0}
3. Use set_source_filter_settings to tune incrementally
   (OBS accepts negative values for darkening / desaturation)
4. Order: chroma_key -> color_filter -> sharpen/blur
```

### Troubleshooting Filters

- **Filter has no visible effect** - Check it's enabled (`toggle_source_filter`)
  and that its index is below any filter that resets the pixel data
  (e.g. `luma_key` after `chroma_key` will undo the key).
- **Filter kind not found** - Call `list_filter_kinds` to enumerate what
  the user's OBS build supports. Plugin-provided filters vary by install.
- **Audio filters silent** - They live on the *input* source, not on a
  scene item. Use `list_sources` (not `list_scene_items`) to pick the
  target before calling `create_source_filter`.

## Layout Design Patterns

### Picture-in-Picture (PiP)

Classic layout with game capture full-screen and webcam in corner:

```
1. Ensure game capture is full canvas:
   - set_source_transform: x: 0, y: 0, scale: 1.0

2. Position webcam in corner:
   - Small PiP (240x135): scale 0.167
   - Bottom-right: x: 1660, y: 925

3. Add subtle border (optional):
   - Create color source slightly larger than webcam
   - Position behind webcam

4. Lock both sources
```

### Split Screen

Two sources side by side:

```
1. Left source:
   - x: 0, y: 0
   - scale_x: 0.5 (half width)

2. Right source:
   - x: 960, y: 0
   - scale_x: 0.5

3. Add divider (optional):
   - Create thin color source
   - Position at x: 958, full height
```

### Centered with Border

Source centered with colored border/frame:

```
1. Create border color source:
   - Full canvas size (1920x1080)
   - Accent color

2. Create inner background:
   - Slightly smaller (1880x1040)
   - Position: x: 20, y: 20

3. Position main content:
   - Centered within inner area
```

### Lower Third

Text/graphics in bottom portion:

```
1. Create background bar:
   - create_color_source: 1920x200
   - Position: x: 0, y: 880
   - Semi-transparent color (alpha in ABGR)

2. Add text:
   - create_text_source with name/title
   - Position in the bar area

3. Optional: Add logo/icon
   - create_image_source
   - Position left of text
```

## Placement

### Let OBS do the arithmetic

Centring and corner-anchoring used to be documented here as formulas over the
source's width and height. Do not use them. They need a source size you often
cannot get -- a browser source reports 0x0 until the page loads -- and they go
stale the moment the asset behind the source is replaced.

| Intent | Call |
|--------|------|
| Centre on the canvas | `fit: { mode: "fit" }` |
| Fill the canvas, cropping overflow | `fit: { mode: "fill" }` |
| Flush in a corner | `fit: { mode: "shrink", anchor: "bottom-right", region: {...} }` |
| Picture-in-picture | `fit: { mode: "fit", region: { x, y, width, height } }` |
| Full-canvas layer | `fit: { mode: "none" }` |

The anchor is where the source sits *within its region*, so a corner placement
is a region plus an anchor, not a computed coordinate.

### When you do need explicit coordinates

`x`, `y`, `scale_x`, `scale_y` and `rotation` still work and override `fit`
where both are given. Reach for them for a nudge relative to a known-good
position -- not to compute a layout from scratch.

### Maintaining Aspect Ratio

When scaling, use same value for scale_x and scale_y to maintain aspect ratio:
```
scale_x: 0.5, scale_y: 0.5  // Maintains ratio
scale_x: 0.5, scale_y: 0.3  // Distorted
```

## Cropping Techniques

Crop values remove pixels from edges:

```
set_source_crop:
  top: 50     // Remove 50 pixels from top
  bottom: 50  // Remove 50 pixels from bottom
  left: 100   // Remove 100 pixels from left
  right: 100  // Remove 100 pixels from right
```

### Use Cases

1. **Remove black bars** from video sources
2. **Focus on face** in webcam
3. **Hide UI elements** in game capture
4. **Create letterbox effect** for cinematic look

## Bounds and Alignment

Bounds control how sources fit within a defined area:

### Bound Types
- **None**: No bounds (scale freely)
- **Stretch**: Stretch to fill bounds (may distort)
- **Scale to inner bounds**: Fit within bounds (letterbox/pillarbox)
- **Scale to outer bounds**: Fill bounds (may crop)
- **Scale to width/height**: Match one dimension

### Alignment
Controls anchor point within bounds:
- Center, Top, Bottom, Left, Right
- Combinations: Top-Left, Top-Right, Bottom-Left, Bottom-Right

## Source Ordering (Z-Index)

Sources are layered:
- **Higher index** = Closer to viewer (on top)
- **Lower index** = Further away (behind)

### Order Operations
```
set_source_order options:
- "front": Bring to absolute front
- "back": Send to absolute back
- "forward": Move up one layer
- "backward": Move down one layer
```

### Typical Layer Order (back to front)
1. Background (color/image)
2. Game/screen capture
3. Webcam
4. Overlays (alerts, chat)
5. Text elements

## Best Practices

### Source Naming
- Use descriptive names: "Bottom Right Webcam" not "Webcam1"
- Include position/purpose in name for clarity
- Avoid generic names that could conflict

### Before Major Changes
1. Check current state with `get_source_transform`
2. Note existing position/scale for potential rollback
3. Make incremental changes, verify each step

### Performance Considerations
- Browser sources: Use only what's needed (each uses resources)
- Large images: Resize before importing when possible
- Media sources: Consider codec and resolution

### Locking Strategy
- Lock sources once positioned correctly
- Lock background elements immediately
- Unlock only when adjustments needed

### Common Resolutions

| Name | Resolution | Aspect Ratio |
|------|------------|--------------|
| 1080p (Full HD) | 1920x1080 | 16:9 |
| 720p (HD) | 1280x720 | 16:9 |
| 1440p | 2560x1440 | 16:9 |
| 4K (UHD) | 3840x2160 | 16:9 |

## Example Workflows

### Example 1: Complete Starting Soon Screen

**User Request**: "Create a starting soon screen"

**Response Pattern**:
```
1. "Let me create a professional starting soon screen..."

2. Create background:
   - create_color_source: "Starting Background"
   - Color: Dark gradient-friendly color (0xFF1a1a2e)

3. Add title text:
   - create_text_source: "Starting Soon Title"
   - Text: "STARTING SOON"
   - Font size: 72
   - Position: centered, upper third (x: 960, y: 300)

4. Add countdown/info area:
   - create_text_source: "Stream Info"
   - Text: "Stream starts shortly..."
   - Font size: 36
   - Position: centered, middle (x: 960, y: 540)

5. Add social handles:
   - create_text_source: "Social Links"
   - Text: "@username on Twitter/Twitch"
   - Font size: 24
   - Position: bottom center (x: 960, y: 900)

6. Lock all sources:
   - set_source_locked for each source

7. Confirm:
   - "Created Starting Soon screen with title, info text, and social links"
   - "All elements locked in place"
```

### Example 2: Webcam Resize and Reposition

**User Request**: "Make my webcam smaller and put it in the top left"

**Response Pattern**:
```
1. "Let me adjust your webcam..."

2. Get current transform:
   - get_source_transform for webcam source
   - Note current size for reference

3. Calculate new position and scale:
   - Top-left with margin: x: 20, y: 20
   - Smaller scale: 0.15 (about 288x162 for 1080p source)

4. Apply transform:
   - set_source_transform:
     - x: 20, y: 20
     - scale_x: 0.15, scale_y: 0.15

5. Lock in place:
   - set_source_locked: true

6. Confirm:
   - "Webcam moved to top-left corner and scaled to 15%"
   - "Source locked to prevent accidental movement"
```

### Example 3: Adding Alert Widget

**User Request**: "Add my StreamElements alerts"

**Response Pattern**:
```
1. "I'll add your StreamElements alert box..."

2. Ask for URL:
   - "Please provide your StreamElements widget URL"

3. User provides URL

4. Create browser source:
   - create_browser_source:
     - source_name: "StreamElements Alerts"
     - url: [user's URL]
     - width: 800, height: 600

5. Position in visible area:
   - set_source_transform:
     - x: 560, y: 100 (upper center)

6. Ensure visibility:
   - set_source_order: "front"

7. Confirm:
   - "Alert box added at top center"
   - "It will display when alerts trigger"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Source not visible
```
1. Check if source is hidden (toggle_source_visibility)
2. Check z-order (might be behind other sources)
3. Check position (might be off-canvas)
4. Check scale (might be scaled to 0)
```

### Source appears distorted
```
1. Check scale_x and scale_y are equal
2. Check bounds type isn't "stretch"
3. Verify source's native resolution
```

### Can't move source
```
1. Check if source is locked (set_source_locked to unlock)
2. Verify correct scene_item_id
3. Confirm source exists in current scene
```

### Text not readable
```
1. Increase font_size
2. Add contrasting background color source
3. Check text color against background
4. Consider adding outline/shadow in OBS UI
```
