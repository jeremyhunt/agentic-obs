# Claude Skills for agentic-obs

This directory contains Claude Skills that teach Claude how to effectively orchestrate the agentic-obs MCP server. These skills provide domain-specific expertise for managing OBS Studio through AI assistance.

## What are Claude Skills?

Claude Skills are structured markdown files that teach Claude how to use MCP tools effectively for specific domains. Each skill contains:

- **Trigger conditions**: When Claude should activate the skill
- **Tool inventory**: Which MCP tools are relevant for the task
- **Workflow guidance**: Step-by-step procedures for common operations
- **Best practices**: Domain-specific recommendations and tips
- **Examples**: Concrete use cases with input/output patterns

Skills enhance Claude's ability to orchestrate complex multi-tool workflows, provide context-aware recommendations, and apply domain expertise to user requests.

### 5. Studio Mode Operator (`studio-mode-operator`)

**When to use**: Two-scene preview/program workflow — staging scenes
privately before putting them live, rehearsing transitions, or directing
a broadcast with a separation between what's being prepared and what's
on air.

**Key capabilities**:
- Enabling and exiting studio mode
- Preview-side scene staging (`set_preview_scene`)
- Transition type selection (cut/fade/slide) and duration tuning
- Promoting preview to program via `trigger_transition`

**Best for**: Broadcast operators, multi-segment shows, and anyone who
needs to stage scene changes privately before committing them to the
live output. Use `streaming-assistant` for whole-session workflows that
only incidentally touch studio mode.

---

### 6. Advanced Scene Switcher (`advanced-scene-switcher`)

**When to use**: Triggering Advanced Scene Switcher macros, pushing plugin variables, broadcasting websocket messages to OBS automation

**Key capabilities**:
- Direct macro triggering with optional atomic variable pre-set
- Plugin variable updates (single or bulk) to drive condition-based automation
- Websocket message broadcast for fan-out to multiple macros
- Condition/action mental model: MCP pushes state, Advanced Scene Switcher reacts

**Tools used**: `ass_run_macro`, `ass_send_message`, `ass_set_variables`, `ass_set_variable`

**Best for**: Users who have Advanced Scene Switcher macros configured in OBS and want the MCP server to drive them from external events (game state, bot audio, Riot API data, screenshot parse results).

## Using Skills Effectively

### Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: Describe what you want to achieve rather than which tools to use
   - Good: "Create a centered title that says 'LIVE' in red"
   - Better: "Create a centered title overlay that says 'LIVE' in red, positioned at the top of the screen"

2. **Provide context**: Mention the scene or sources you're working with
   - "In my Gaming scene, hide the webcam and show the full-screen game capture"

3. **Use natural language**: Skills enable Claude to understand domain terminology
   - "Mix down the music and boost my voice" (audio-engineer understands this)

4. **Iterate**: Skills support multi-step refinement
   - "Make that text bigger... no, a bit smaller... and move it left"

### Example Workflows

**Pre-stream Setup** (streaming-assistant):
```
User: "Help me get ready to stream"

Claude uses streaming-assistant skill to:
1. Check OBS connection status
2. List all scenes and sources
3. Verify audio inputs are unmuted
4. Check audio levels are appropriate
5. Confirm streaming settings
6. Provide pre-stream checklist
```

**Creating a Lower Third** (scene-designer):
```
User: "Create a lower third with my name and title"

Claude uses scene-designer skill to:
1. Create a color source for the background bar
2. Create a text source for the name
3. Create a text source for the title
4. Position and scale all elements
5. Apply appropriate styling
```

**Audio Troubleshooting** (audio-engineer):
```
User: "My microphone sounds quiet"

Claude uses audio-engineer skill to:
1. List all audio sources
2. Check microphone mute status
3. Get current volume level
4. Recommend volume adjustment
5. Verify changes took effect
```

**Preset Switching** (preset-manager):
```
User: "Switch to my 'BRB' preset"

Claude uses preset-manager skill to:
1. List available presets to confirm 'BRB' exists
2. Get preset details to explain what will change
3. Apply the preset
4. Confirm application success
```

## Combining Skills

Claude can use multiple skills in a single workflow:

**Example**: "Set up my Gaming scene with the webcam in the corner, then save it as a preset"
- Uses `scene-designer` to position the webcam
- Uses `preset-manager` to save the configuration

**Example**: "Prepare my stream and check the audio"
- Uses `streaming-assistant` for pre-stream setup
- Uses `audio-engineer` for detailed audio verification
